Generate new look-alike words, via a model trained on the famous poem "Luceafarul" by Mihai Eminescu.
The project is using a Decoder Transformer.

Since the dataset input is small and the mapping of integers is performed at characters levels only, the newly generated content is not of high quality.
The model requires more data training and fine tunning.
