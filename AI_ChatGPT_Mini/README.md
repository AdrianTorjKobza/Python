Generate new look-alike words, via a model trained on the famous poem "Luceafarul" by Mihai Eminescu.
The project is using the Transformer architecture.

Since the dataset input is small and the mapping of integers is performed at characters levels only, the newly generated content is not of high quality.
To improve the model, we need word indexing, more data training & fine tunning.
